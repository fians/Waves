2. Install SASS via RubyGems (`gem install sass`).
3. Install Situs globally via npm (`npm install situs -g`).
4. Clone Waves's Github repository, if you haven't already (`git clone https://github.com/fians/Waves.git`).
5. Run `npm install` to install the necessary local node packages.
6. Install grunt globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
7. Run `grunt` to watch the directory, or simply `grunt build` to do a single build.
